# QuasiHubbard

QuasiHubbard is a Python-based tool for generating the Wannier functions and Hubbard Hamiltonians of quasicrystalline potentials. The Wannier functions are constructed using the method developed in [1]. In short, we compute maximally localised non-orthogonal Wannier functions locally at each lattice site. We then orthogonalise them using a LÃ¶wdin Transform. The Hubbard Hamiltonian is then computed by evaluating the relevant matrix elements between Wannier functions. The script currently handles the case of the eightfold optical quasicrystal only, but additional optical quasicrystals will soon be added in the features.

Energies are expressed in recoil energy $E_{rec} = \hbar^2 k^2 / (2 m)$, and distances in units of the optical lattice wavelength $\lambda$, and $k = 2\pi / \lambda$. The eightfold quasicrystalline optical potential is given by:

$$V(\mathbf{r}) = V_0 \sum_{i=1}^4 \cos^2{(\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{r} + \phi_i  )} $$

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Joblib

## Quick Start

You can execute the script by running the following command:

```
python quasi_hubbard.py [lattice depth] [system_diameter]
```

Replace `[lattice depth]` with the desired lattice depth in units of recoil energy, and `[system_diameter]` the desired system radius in units of the wavelength $\lambda$.

## How It Works

### Define Lattice Parameters

The script starts by defining several parameters for the lattice system. It includes variables like system size, lattice depth, grid spacing and cut-off radius.

### File Management

The script saves results and temporary data in a structured directory hierarchy, facilitating better organization and easier retrieval of computational results.

### Parallel Computations

For computationally intensive tasks such as constructing the Wannier functions, computing the Hamiltonian matrix elements, overlap matrix, and off-site interactions calculations, the script leverages parallel computing for improved efficiency.
